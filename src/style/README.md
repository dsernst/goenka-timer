# Herein Lies The Global Styles

All global styles (written using the [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) style language) shall be stored in this folder.

Optionally, instead of creating new `.less` files, you may modify `main.less` directly. Just be sure to *only* add your LESS code where indicated.

\* **Do not** change the contents of the `material-ui` folder. It's been automatically generated, and any changes to it will be undone!
